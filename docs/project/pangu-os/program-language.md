  - [Two-way Dataflow](https://vimeo.com/106073134): Output is handled with traditional one-way dataflow,
    which is realized here as a form of pure lazy functional programming.
    Input is governed by a new semantics called one-way action
    which is a highly restricted form of event-driven imperative programming.
    These restrictions statically order event execution to avoid callback hell.
    Two-way dataflow has been designed not only to simplify the semantics of application programming
    but also to support a presentation that, like a spreadsheet,
    provides a fully WYSIWYG programming experience.
